Assignment 5
Perform image segmentation on all images in the dataset, using the normalized cut algorithm running on the top of superpixels rather than on raw pixels.
For each image compute an accuracy metric (which one it is up to you to decide) measuring the overlap between the segments identified by NCUT and the ground truth horse semantic segmentation.
Provide a table summarizing the average segmentation accuracy on all images, plus present 2 examples of images that are well-segmented (according to the above defined metric).
